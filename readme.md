# Content Visibility Geolocation Add-On

Content Visibility Geolocation is an add-on for [Content Visibility](https://wordpress.org/plugins/content-visibility/) - a plugin which allows you to decide when, where, and to whom each piece of your content is shown (or hidden!).

The geolocation add-on allows you to show or hide any of your content blocks to users visiting your site from any country of your choosing.

Need to only show a message to folks visiting from Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦? No problems, eh.

How about showing a banner to your British ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ visitors? You got it, guvnor. (I'm a Brit living in Canada ;) )

## Content Visibility

Works alongside the core [Content Visibility plugin](https://github.com/richardtape/content-visibility) and [Date and Time add-on](https://github.com/richardtape/content-visibility-date-and-time) meaning you can schedule blocks for dates and times and only shown them to those users signed in with a specific role from a specific country!
